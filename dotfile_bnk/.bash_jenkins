# To have launchd start jenkins at login:
#     ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/jenkins/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
# Then to load jenkins now:
#     launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.jenkins.plist
# Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
#     java -jar /usr/local/opt/jenkins/libexec/jenkins.war
